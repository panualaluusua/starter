# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

## 2. Core Features
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- What it does
- Why it's important
- How it works at a high level]

## 3. User Experience
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- User personas
- Key user flows
- UI/UX considerations]

## 4. Technical Architecture
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

## 5. Development Roadmap
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

## 6. Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

## 8. Appendix
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
